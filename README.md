# OpenCVDemo

OpenCV demo using examples from FTC.  The `Exercises` directory
contains 10 python programs with various pieces missing.  Your job is
to fill in those missing pieces and learn about OpenCV along the way.

Solutions are in the `Solutions` directory, but don't peek unless you
are really stuck.  Work though it.

You might want to clone our 2024-2025

repo.  It contains several additional pictures to test the exercise
on.  They are in the `shuban-789/cvlocal/images` subdirectory.
